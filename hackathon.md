# Hackathon Task: Data-Driven Web Application

## Description
Develop a web application that leverages CSV data for both display and functionality. The application should be capable of handling large datasets efficiently, provide real-time feedback during uploads, and offer a seamless user experience.

## Requirements
1. **CSV Upload Service:**
   - Create a feature allowing users to upload CSV files.
   - Ensure the service efficiently handles large datasets.
   - Implement real-time progress indicators to keep users informed during uploads.

2. **Data Display and Pagination:**
   - Display the uploaded data on the UI post-upload completion.
   - Implement pagination for smooth navigation through large datasets.
   - Ensure the UI remains responsive even with extensive data.

3. **Subscription Pricing Calculator:**
   - Utilize the uploaded CSV data to develop a subscription pricing calculator.
   - Calculate and display subscription pricing based on the uploaded data.

## Subscription Pricing Formula
To calculate the subscription pricing based on credit score and the number of credit lines mentioned in the CSV, use the following formula:

Let:
- `CreditScore` be the credit score obtained from the CSV data.
- `CreditLines` be the number of credit lines mentioned in the CSV.
- `BasePrice` be the base price for the subscription.
- `PricePerCreditLine` be the additional price per credit line.
- `PricePerCreditScorePoint` be the additional price per credit score point.

Then, the subscription price (`SubscriptionPrice`) can be calculated as follows:


## Additional Details
- Utilize suitable technologies for both backend and frontend development.
- Prioritize responsive design for a seamless experience across various devices.
- Pay close attention to user feedback during uploads and data display.
- Thoroughly test the application to identify and resolve any bugs or performance issues.
- Provide comprehensive documentation covering setup, usage, and any additional information.

## Deliverables
- Fully functional web application with CSV upload, data display with pagination, and subscription pricing calculator.
- Detailed documentation including setup instructions, usage guide, and any relevant information.
- Presentation or demo showcasing the application's features and functionality.

## Judging Criteria
- **Functionality:** Does the application meet all specified requirements and provide seamless functionality?
- **User Experience:** Is the UI intuitive and user-friendly? Does the application provide real-time feedback during uploads and maintain responsiveness?
- **Performance:** How efficiently does the application handle large datasets and calculate subscription pricing?
- **Innovation:** Are there any unique features or approaches that enhance the application's utility or usability?
- **Presentation:** How effectively is the application demonstrated and explained during the presentation or demo?

## Note
Participants are encouraged to collaborate, innovate, and demonstrate creativity in their solutions. Good luck!

## Generating Test Data
Use the following shell script to generate a CSV file with 200,000 entries containing random user data:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
